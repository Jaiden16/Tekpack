# Tekpack

A lot of the waste in the fashion industry comes from desingers trying to communicate fashion designs to their suppliers or factories. Factories produce samples based on a reference garment with product specs and a sketch. A "tech pack" helps them troubleshoot before any fabric is cut but many problems can arise from this stunted communication flow.

Tekpack will allow dynamic updating between designer and the supplier point of contact creating a collaborative tech pack. They can make real time updates and reduce human error to create a better communication flow between designer and factory. 

The app will have a detailed spec sheet and picture upload for the reference garment sketch. Collaborators can also comment on the project for constant communication. 
The designer can upload or re-upload photos to change or update a design.
The tech designer can input and update specâ€™s according to the products. The supplier can upload samples and get approval before sending them out.

The whole process will cut down on waste in the supply chain and prevent costly mistakes in production.
